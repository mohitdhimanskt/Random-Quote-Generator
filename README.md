PROJECT: Random Quote Generator

    Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

    Write the project code in the folder Week1 \ project.

In this week's project you'll be making a Random Quote Generator! It includes a text box and a simple button that, when clicked, take a random quote out of a set amount of quotes and show it in the page. Here's how it should look:
